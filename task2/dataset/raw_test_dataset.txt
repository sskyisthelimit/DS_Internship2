My dog is a chihuahua mix and she’s 16 and is declining in health.
She’s on a chicken and rice diet because she was vomiting and it had blood in it.
She hasn’t thrown up since I started the chicken and rice but I look at her and all I can think about is how she’s in pain.
I do get angry when I see posts where the dog is actively dying and the owner is "should I take him to the vet?
My Shih Tzu got diagnosed with kidney disease a year ago, and recently it worsened a lot.
Pilot whales are the only animal with a higher brain-to-body mass ratio than humans, and they regularly commit mass suicide by beaching in the hundreds or thousands due to echolocation malfunctions.
Squirrels plant thousands of trees every year by forgetting where they buried their nuts.
Wombats have cube-shaped poop and backward-facing pouches to keep dirt out while digging.
Giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as humans—seven.
Spider silk is initially liquid and hardens into a material five times stronger than steel.
I always get chills when I see a spider crawling on my ceiling; it's both fascinating and terrifying.
I once spent an entire afternoon watching a spider build its web—it was like witnessing a master artist at work.
I love how some Reddit threads celebrate the beauty of spiders, even if most people find them creepy.
The contrast between a spider's delicate web and its fierce hunting skills is something I find endlessly fascinating.
Despite my fear, I've grown to respect spiders after learning about their role in balancing nature.
Butterflies are a sign of good luck, I always feel happy when I see one.
I've taken a lot of photos of the butterflies I saw in Leyte, Philippines, including the Atlas Moth.
I'm trying to create a butterfly-friendly habitat in my backyard.
I'm fascinated by the monarch butterfly migration, it's such an incredible journey.
Anyone know what kind of butterfly this is? It's got black and yellow stripes.
Monarch Butterflies are in danger. The numbers are steadily going down and the annual migration is in danger of disappearing.
The best way to help butterflies is by giving them habitat, both host plants for caterpillars, and native local nectar plants.
Usually by this time there are eggs and cats all over my host plants.
I have only seen one monarch in my yard in CT, and it’s July.
I put pots of dill out in my garden and when they get covered in swallowtails I transfer them into a net enclosure to keep the birds from eating them and release them when they grow up.
I have Highland cattle.
We have a mix of Hereford and Galloway (oreo) cows.
We have been doing sheep for 13 years and have never bothered with wool sheep.
We do purebred Herefords, but the last couple years we’ve thrown a black Angus in with some of our heifers to get the most beautiful black baldies.
Look into the Polypay breed.
If you want wool and meat, the Gulf Coast is awesome because it is very parasite resistant.
We stick with St Croix, which produce twins with alarming regularity twice a year and grow into good sized sheep quickly.
I started with Icelandics but quickly found that hybrids have better growth rates and survivability.
I have a Rocky Mountain Horse.
I have an ex-Amish Percheron and she's wonderful! Lots of them go to rescue too.
My favorite ride is a retired Argentine Thoroughbred polo pony.
Tall ones, small ones, bratty ponies, draft crosses, piebalds and tobianos and wall-eyed ones.
The little Eurasian red ones with feathery ears they look magical, otherworldly to me.
I’d love to see a black squirrel one day.
They're melanistic grey squirrels and are all over the NE US.
I've seen large black squirrels with white noses many times over the years and refuse to believe it's been the same squirrel every time.
The African bush elephant and the Asian elephant are both listed as endangered by the IUCN.
The difference in genus name between African (Loxodonta) and Asian (Elephas) elephants is due to advances made in paleontology.
The African Bush Elephants, especially the big tuskers, could be introduced on trial to the Southwest plains.
The Asian Elephants could be introduced in the Southeastern forests to replace the extinct Mastodons that once roamed there.
Elephants eat primary producers.
An animal the size of an elephant would end up requiring orders of magnitudes more surface area to radiate heat.
Brazilian wandering spiders the one animal I truly, genuinely fear.
Brown recluse, worst spider bite you can get.
Trapdoor spider butts freak me out.
True Spiders are roughly the size of mastiffs and can communicate telepathically.
Araneid is a constructed language that is exclusively adapted for use by spiders.
Not necessarily a death sentence, but it depends on the type of spider and where you live!
 Now I realize the whole time she was talking about Pallas Cats!
 Sand cats are another absolute W cat.
 It's wild, the smallest feline in the world stays the size of a kitten.
